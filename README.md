## Abstract

Each user of [DeckDeckGo] gets a canister smart contract for the static assets (images, csv data, html content).

When a presentation or document is published, the content is uploaded to the canister in form of an HTML file.

The canister only serves public content and, as soon as such data exists, becomes a PWA of all the decks and documents the user would have shared publicly.

Templates generated by this kit and pushed to GitHub are synchronized, refreshed within the canister, when user publish content from the editor.

## Usage

⚙️ Build these kit's templates

```
npm run build
```
